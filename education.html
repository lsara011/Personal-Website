  <div class="question">
    <h2>Where do I get my knowledge from?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <h3>A mixture of sources, really. Whether it's from the internet or in school, there are multiple
    resources that I have stumbled upon that helped me get to where I want to be in the future. I'll break down a few of the resources that
    I personally use. </h3>

        <h3>Florida International University</h3>
        <p>This is where I graduated with my first Bachelors. This was also where I began my
        second Bachelor's in IT before moving to a different college. FIU's resources to its students have been the most impactful to my studies.
        I would use the library at FIU to study when I'm on campus late night since I live(at the time of this writing) at the very east of Miami. I would also use the tutoring
          services that are available to me when I need help with a certain topic. I have started learning Java here as well as data and discrete structuring. I have also learned about working within the operating system, using a virtual machine,
        and knowing the psychology of computer human interaction. My first and second bachelors come hand in hand: First one is the study of consumer serves in various
        aspects of the industry. My second is writing and implementing software for clients. They both meet when speaking with clients and creating great connections while
        working with tech. I have met a plethora of people with different backgrounds and attitudes, so i'm able to work with anyone.</p>

        <h3>YouTube</h3>
        <p>Yes, Youtube. This may seem odd considering the website isn't a feasible substitute for someone going to school. But YouTube ultimately helped me understand concepts a little better
        especially when it comes to sorting algorithms, for example. YouTube's massive website includes videos on topics such as Data Structuring, Sorting Algorithms, Recursion, and so on and so forth. This is what i also use to refresh on
        syntax of certain languages that I know. For example, Golang is a unique programming language made by Google. The language is still relatively new since it was created in 2009. The syntax for Golang can be hard to understand, but with youtube
        and examples, it makes it easier to grasp the concept. Also, i like to watch other software engineers in their daily life as one, which inspires me and gives me the drive to continue. </p>

        <h3>CodeCademy</h3>
        <p>CodeCademy is where I learned every other language in. I frequent the website more often on my free time. I learned how to create web pages with the Front-End Development course that is offered at the CodeCademy
          (Currently going through the Full Stack Development course to better understand the front and back end of the website). The website is more hands on than YouTube and you can go at your own pace, finishing whenever you like.
          This website has a variety of content to choose from. They offer app development for Android and iOS using Java and Swift, Business Analytics using Python and SQL, and even AI. When i saw the promotion that they had on YouTube, I took a leap
          of faith and subscribed to their Pro Plan, and so far its been worth every single dollar.
