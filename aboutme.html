        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="question-answer">
        <p>My name is Luis Saravia. I was born in Little Havana within the beautiful city of Miami.
          I was raised in Plantation, Florida where I spent most of my childhood in. I like to play Football, play music,
          learning how to code, and spending time with family and friends. I work full time at Kush Hospitality Services as a Cook while studying Software Engineering
          in school. </p>

        <h2>Why Tech?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="question-answer">
        <p>I am passionate about technology and its continuous evolution. I find the incredible advancements in this field fascinating. For instance, in the past, we relied on paper maps for navigation, but now, we have large screens in malls that provide real-time guidance and even track our movements. These innovations inspire me to pursue a career as a Software Engineer, where I hope to contribute to the ongoing technological revolution and leave a positive impact on society</p>

        <h2>Why Hospitality?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="question-answer">
        <p>Recognizing the importance of strong interpersonal relations in the tech industry, I graduated from Florida International University in 2023 with a Bachelor's in Interdisciplinary Studies, emphasizing Hospitality. My academic journey included two minors in Hospitality Studies and Restaurant and Foodservice Management. The choice of my degree and minors stems from my seven years of experience in the restaurant industry, starting when I was 17.
          The joy I derive from seeing smiles on guests' faces, both when they enjoy the food I create and when I share my culinary skills with my staff, has been a driving force throughout my career. This hands-on experience in Hospitality has equipped me with valuable insights into understanding consumer behavior.
          I believe that the skills developed in Hospitality are transferable to the tech field, especially when working with clients for web development. Whether interacting with guests or clients, reading body language and understanding their emotions is crucial. This ability to connect on a personal level enhances my approach to creating websites that cater to the unique needs and experiences of each client.</p>

        <h2>What are my goals?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="question-answer">
        <p>To be completely honest, I haven't defined my specific career goals yet, and that's perfectly okay. I'm currently immersed in my studies, absorbing new technologies every day in class. Like many others, I believe everyone is on a unique journey, still discovering their passions and purpose in life. While I don't have a clear picture of the exact role I want in the tech industry, I am committed to building a career in this field for the long haul. The 'what' in tech is a question I'm excited to explore as I continue my learning journey.</p>

        <h2>Best life lesson?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="question-answer">
        <p>Zachary Fertel's(Hope all is well!!) advice, 'Learn to ask for help, set your pride aside, and know when to ask for help,' has resonated with me for a long time. As a supervisor in my previous role, where I served as the Manager-On-Duty responsible for overseeing the restaurant in the absence of a manager, this lesson became particularly relevant. On one occasion, Zach observed me managing the Window, the crucial interface between the Front of House and the Back of House, with multiple orders piling up. His insight reminded me of the importance of seeking support when needed, emphasizing that pride should never hinder the efficiency of the team.</p>
